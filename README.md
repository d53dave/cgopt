# CSAOpt - A Cloud GPU based Simulated Annealing Optimization Framework.

The main premise of this framework is that a user provides the implementation for an abstract base class that describes the *standard* way of doing Simulated Annealing while CSAOpt takes care of starting, configuring and running a massively parallel flavor of Simulated Annealing on GPUs hosted in the cloud.
