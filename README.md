# CSAOpt - A Cloud GPU based Simulated Annealing Optimization Framework. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/d53dave/csaopt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/d53dave/csaopt) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/d53dave/csaopt/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/d53dave/csaopt?branch=master)

The main premise of this framework is that a user provides the implementation for an abstract base class that describes the *standard* way of doing Simulated Annealing while CSAOpt takes care of starting, configuring and running a massively parallel flavor of Simulated Annealing on GPUs hosted in the cloud¹.

## Usage

TBD

### DISCLAIMER

If you are using CSAOpt together with AWS/EC2, this will incur costs on your registered payment method (i.e. your credit card). CSAOpt will try to make sure that instances are only run during normal operation, are properly shutdown when the software terminates and will print a **big, fat warning** if it cannot verify that everything was terminated upon exit. 

I will not be responsible for any of the costs generated by using CSAOpt. This software is provided **as is** and should be handled with the appropriate care.

**Always** [make sure that no instances are left running after CSAOpt terminates](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/). 

## Configuration

The configuration is based on typesafes/lightbends [HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) and integrated with the excellent [pyhocon](https://github.com/chimpler/pyhocon). The main configuration (i.e. configuration for running the software) is located in `conf/csaopt.conf`. In addition, there is an internal configuration file under `app/internal/csaopt-internal.conf`, which does not need to be modified under normal circumstances. A detailed description and listing of supported configuration will follow here.

## Requirements

This software will not run on Windows out of the box, but it might run in the [WSL](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl). It will probably run on MacOS, but this is untested as of now. If you want to run it on a recent Linux distribution, you are in luck. Development was done on [ElementaryOS](https://elementary.io/), while the deployed AWS intances are based on Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS.

Required software:
- Python 3.5 or higher
- [Pipenv](http://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) is not strictly required, but recommended
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) credentials or a local GPU capable of running [CUDA](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/cuda) computations.
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 4.9 or later ([clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) is not yet supported, but I will be looking into that)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.3 or higher
- Development package for [libzmq3](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libzmq3-dev), from your favourite package manager.

If you choose to run `csaopt` without `pipenv` and a virtual environment, you need to make sure you manually install the required Python packages, e.g. by using `pip`. You can find the exact list of dependencies in the `[packages]` section of the [Pipfile](Pipfile), and the required versions in the [Pipfile.lock](Pipfile.lock).

A special note regarding `zmq`. The guys from `zeromq` pulled off a nice stunt, as the [pyzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq) package will try to build it's own `libzmq` Python extension if it doesn't detect `libzmq` on your system. Make sure to manually install [Cython](http://cython.org/) if you need to rely on `pyzmq` building the extension.

## Development

Currently, the python development is based on 
[pipenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv) for 
dependencies and the virtual environment. The C++ parts are 
developed using CMake.

#### Running the Test Suite

From outsite of the `virtualenv` the test suite can be executed from the project root using

```bash
pipenv run py.test -v tests
```

From inside the `virtualenv` (i.e. after executing `pipenv shell`), the suite can be executed using

```bash
pytest
#or
py.test
```

#### End-to-End Test

The end-to-end test suite is disabled by default, since it requires a complete setup, i.e. including AWS credentials. Therefore, running the test will incur some costs. The costs should be relatively low, given that the provided test optimization should only run for a few seconds. AWS, however, charges a whole hour even if the instances are terminated after a few seconds.

The AWS credentials for the end-to-end tests need to be provided as environment variables, as documented in [awstools.py](app/aws/awstools.py).

The test suite is activated by setting a environment variable called `CSAOPT_RUN_E2E`. The contents are irrelevant, it should evaluate to a [truthy value inside Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing). 

After setting the appropriate environment variables, the whole suite can be executed and will include the end-to-end tests (see above). If you want to run just the end-to-end tests, you can use the following command from the `virtualenv`:

```bash
py.test -s test_e2e.py::test_end2end
```

## Change History

> 0.1.0 Change to Python

With v0.1.0, most C++ code was abandoned. It became clear 
that writing and maintaining this piece of software in C++
was never a good idea. Or, in other words, after chasing
obscure bugs where they should not be, I gave up. The initial 
thought was not to split the codebase into multiple languages for 
the sake of the current and future developers and maintainers. 
This split will gradually be introduced, resulting, ideally, in
a structure where all glue code, i.e. config parsing, command line 
interface, user interaction, networking and reporting will be 
done in Python. The core concept of a user writing a small
model as C++ code which will be executed in a simulated annealing
pipeline on graphics processors will remain.

> 0.0.x C++ prototypes

Versions 0.0.x were prototypes written in C++, 
including the proof of concept which was demo-ed to 
my thesis supervisor and colleagues. These versions were
undocumented and development was sporadic. Most changes
did not make it into version control and features
were added and abandoned at will. The last version of the
C++ prototype in this repo was commit [6c922f](https://github.com/d53dave/csaopt/tree/6c922f933eceb8992e9acae36f1767336c56209f).

## Notes
¹ Currently, only AWS EC2 is suported.
